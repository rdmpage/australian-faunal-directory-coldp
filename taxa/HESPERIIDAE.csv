Braby (2010) pointed out that Lower (1908, p. 312) actually corrected the original spelling to <I>monotherma</I> ?The name is misprinted <I>monotherm</I>.?, and placed it in the genus <I>Hesperilla</I> Hewitson, 1868. The gender of both <I>Telesto</I> Boisduval, 1832, and <I>Hesperilla</I> is feminine, but because <I>monotherm</I> is a noun in apposition the species group name does not need to change. However, since <I>monotherm</I> is an incorrect original spelling that, prior to publication of the Checklist (Atkins & Edwards 1996) has had no usage, Lower?s subsequent correction to <I>monotherma</I> should be maintained","Lower","1908","Y","0618bc03-c342-4015-947e-1900a3480325","20220217T06:51:33.439+0000","14d42a1f-edb8-4158-afeb-e6f9a620ef8b","20220513T02:56:12.474+0000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
