Hendel (1908) included two species: <em>Musca cursitans</em> Fabricius, 1775 and <em>Musca cimicoides</em> Fabricius, 1779, but did not designate a type species. Coquillett (1910) designated <em>Tachydromia connexa</em> Meigen, 1803 as type species, but this was not originally included and there are no other published type designations for this genus-group name. To fix the name, Evenhuis & Pape select <em>Musca cimicoides</em> Fabricius, 1779 [= <em>Musca arrogans</em> Linnaeus, 1761], by subsequent designation. <em>Musca cimicoides</em> Fabricius, 1779 is currently treated in <em>Tachydromia</em> Meigen, 1803, which makes <em>Coryneta</em> Meigen in Hendel, 1908 a junior synonym of <em>Tachydromia</em> Meigen, 1803 (Evenhuis & Pape 2017)","Meigen in Hendel","1908","Y","22b8ecf5-bae3-4070-a9b5-ded9033b9bfb","20220526T05:18:44.529+0000","ecf6e857-0246-4d14-b304-9e0974860342","20220616T08:56:19.144+0000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
