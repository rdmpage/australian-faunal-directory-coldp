Hendel (1908) included a single species: <em>Musca senilis</em> Fabricius, 1794, which is the type species by monotypy. <em>Musca senilis</em> Fabricius, 1794 is currently treated in <em>Scenopinus</em> Latreille, 1802, which makes <em>Omphrale</em> Meigen in Hendel, 1908 a junior synonym of <em>Scenopinus</em> Latreille, 1802. Melville (1960) considered Meigen?s (1800) <em>Omphrale</em> to be synonymous with <em>Hypselura</em> Meigen, 1803. Hendel (1908) also listed <em>Hypselura</em> Meigen, 1803 as a synonym of <em>Omphrale</em> but listed <em>Scenopinus</em> Latreille, 1802 as a senior synonym to <em>Hypselura</em> Meigen, 1803. Meigen (1804) did not treat species of <em>Scenopinus</em> Latreille, 1802 in the main text, but in the ?Einleitung?
